# GitHub Authentication In Progress

## What's Happening
GitHub CLI has opened a browser window (or provided a link) for you to authenticate.

## Steps to Complete Authentication

1. **Check your browser** - A GitHub authorization page should have opened
2. **If no browser opened**, look for:
   - A one-time code in the terminal (8 characters like `ABCD-1234`)
   - A URL like `https://github.com/login/device`
3. **Enter the code** on the GitHub page
4. **Click "Authorize GitHub CLI"**
5. **Come back here** - I'll automatically continue once authentication is complete

## Waiting for you to complete the authorization...

Once you authorize in the browser, I'll:
- ✅ Push your code to GitHub
- ✅ Guide you through Render deployment
- ✅ Get your permanent public link!

**No need to do anything else - just complete the browser authorization!**
