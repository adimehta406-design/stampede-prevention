## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

The deployment is configured and should be building automatically. Please complete these final verification steps:

### 1. Check Deployment Status (2 minutes)
Open: **https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d4ind90gjchc73epvk4g**

Look for the status:

Once "Live", visit: **https://stampede-prevention-1stampede-prevention.onrender.com**

Expected behavior:
