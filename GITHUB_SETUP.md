## 📋 Next Steps for You

### 1. Sign in to GitHub
You're already on the GitHub sign-in page. Please log in with your GitHub account.

### 2. Create a New Repository
After signing in:
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `stampede-prevention`
   - **Description**: AI Stampede Prevention System
   - **Visibility**: **Public** ✅
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### 3. Copy the Repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stampede-prevention.git
```

**Copy this URL!**

### 4. Share the URL with Me
Come back and paste the GitHub repository URL. I'll:
- Push your code to GitHub
- Guide you through Render deployment
- Get your permanent public link! 🚀

## Commands I'll Run (for reference)
Once you share the URL, I'll execute:
```bash
git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_URL>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then we'll deploy to Render.com for your permanent link!
